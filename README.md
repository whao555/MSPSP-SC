# MSPSP-SC
大家可以讨论算法代码的逻辑，但由于大坝的数据是保密的，没办法直接提供。可以根据拱坝特征，虚拟已有的数据进行尝试。
People can discuss the logic of the algorithmic code, but there is no way to provide it directly as the data from the dam is confidential. It can be attempted by virtual existing data based on arch dam characteristics.
QACO.py, QMainWindow.py and QPourEleData.py are UI documents.
ACOWidget.py contains the improved ACO algorithm.
PourEleDate.py is used to process data.
main.py is the core  document.
BuildDam3D.py is used to create a 3D model of the dam.
